# Intro

_Construction of this site is still in progress._

This site attempts to make a comprehensive collection of digital element maps for DX promoters based on DevOps practice and computational thinking.
The person-in-charge must learn a broad range of knowledge to build flexible, intuitive, reasonable, and profitable systems, then to replace the legacy workloads.
Thus, this site assembles all such relevant domains - BizDataML_LLM_DevSecOps.

**Elements** section contains the fundamental items consist today's digital system.
They cover essential concepts, de-facto standards, useful techniques, and implementations etc.
The domains are categorized to 6 major classes as of now, like the 
[Dewey Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) system.

**Events** section contains major historic events of the items and their predecessors to understand the background histories.
The descriptions are mainly quoted from the 
[Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.

Although this site contains only elements, you will be able to learn further using AI chatbots with correct understanding of each term.

## Policies

Prefer OSS and open formats as they won't interrupt agile decision making due to restrictions and the code will help troubleshooting.
But some essential cloud services are useful and should be included.

No matter for programming languages.
Language is just a tool with a culture, and translation between languages isn't a costly task today.
Multilingual development is natural though it's important to select a proper language which fits the problem domain and culture.

Include human science elements.
DX needs transformation, which needs current people's mind changes, which may need sociological or psychological means for example.

Overall, this landscape focuses on:

- **Cultural Shift:** Involves a change in organizational culture to embrace digital tools and methodologies.
- **Agility:** Encourages adaptability and responsiveness to market changes.
- **Customer-Centric:** Focuses on improving customer engagement and experience.
- **Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between teams to enhance communication and teamwork.
- **Automation**: Utilizing tools and processes to automate repetitive tasks, such as testing and deployment.
- **Feedback Loops:** Emphasizes the importance of rapid feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Abstraction**: Focusing on the essential features of a problem while ignoring irrelevant details.
- **Decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends or similarities in data.
- **Algorithm Design**: Developing step-by-step solutions to problems.
